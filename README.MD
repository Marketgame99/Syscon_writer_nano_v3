here I bring you the source codes and shellcode of the sysconwriter program, the .ino file is only for reading since the one for writing is not available, but with the shellcode compoleto you can create your own program to use it with sysconwriter or use a completely new one.

The codes are from the developer DarknessMonk, all credits to him.
